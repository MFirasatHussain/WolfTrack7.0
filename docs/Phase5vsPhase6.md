| Improvement | Version 5 | Version 6 | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| **Updated Login and Signup page** | Basic Login/Signup validation. The previous version just checked for username and password match. | Added a ‘Confirm Password’ field on the signup page, along with checks for ‘Password Length’ to ensure security, a ‘Username Exists’ check to prevent duplicate usernames, and ‘Strong Password’ validation for character and number inclusion.|
| **Update Admin Login** | No proper distinction between Admin and Student Login. Students were allowed to log in as Admins despite signing up as students. | Fixed the bug, now there is clear validation distinguishing between student and admin logins. |
| **Fixed Skill Check page** | Skill Check page which analyzes the job description didn’t work. | Fixed! Now the page successfully fetches required job skills from job descriptions, making it easier to list the skills needed for a job.|
| **Fixed Send Profile feature** | Static "Send Profile" feature. This feature only allowed one pre-loaded document to be sent.| Now you can email your resume with one click! |
